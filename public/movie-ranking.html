    <h1>Movie Ranking Project</h1>
    <p>The Indian film industry produces more than 1000 films in a year in several regional languages, a tally that is unmatchable. 
        The importance of cinema in India can't be overstated! Cinema in India has a special place in the heart of people. 
        Rajnikant is worshipped in the south. The birthday of superstars like SRK and Salman is no less than a festival for cinema lovers. 
        The cinema has had a profound impact on the lives of individuals and the general population. Cinemas reflect reality and include the elements of society. Cinema is the mirror of reality. Like early theatres, cinema depicts society's crude reality and indulgences.
        Cinema can rejuvenate a person's brain and have a lasting impact on their lives. It has had a positive impact on society as well as a negative one. It is important to distinguish between right and wrong in order to make informed decisions.</p>
